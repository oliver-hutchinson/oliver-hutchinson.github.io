          <h3>Teaching</h3>
          <p>
          I'm a seasoned English Language teacher with ten years experience in the classroom, both in a T1 and T2 capacity. Through this opportunity I have been able to constantly upskill and research new ideas which allows me to convery information clearly and effectively.

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>I originally started learning Python as a hobby but soon fell in love with it. I have learnt many skills such as data manipulation, creating GUI's and many more that I have been able to use in my current position as an Assistant Language Teacher.</p>

          <h3>Video Editing</h3>
          <p>I developed an interest in film making and video editing in my early teens. These skills have evolved since then in making personal YouTube videos as well as videos in my current position. These skills have been particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional classroom teaching has been difficult.</p>
